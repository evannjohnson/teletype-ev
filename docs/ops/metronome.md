## Metronome

An internal metronome executes the M script at a specified rate (in ms). By default the metronome is enabled (`M.ACT 1`) and set to 1000ms (`M 1000`). The metro can be set as fast as 25ms (`M 25`). An additional `M!` op allows for setting the metronome to experimental rates as high as 2ms (`M! 2`). **WARNING**: when using a large number of i2c commands in the M script at metro speeds beyond the 25ms teletype stability issues can occur.

Access the M script directly with alt-F10 or run the script once using F10.
