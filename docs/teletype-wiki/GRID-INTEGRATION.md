With grid/teletype integration you can use grid to visualize, control and execute teletype scripts. It's not a fixed UI with predefined functions, instead you can define your own UI using scripts. Special grid operators are provided for creating typical controls such as faders and buttons.

Since everything is scriptable, many different user interfaces are possible, adjusted for each scene's specific needs. Make your own sequencers. Switch between different pages with the param knob, or monome walk. You could even create a UI that reacts to changes in the patch as it unfolds - how about controlling brightness with an LFO?

**Important**: older revisions of teletype (with green PCB) are not able to provide sufficient power (even to smaller grids), so if you want to use this functionality you **must** power grid externally using [monome switch](https://monome.org/docs/switch/), [2 > 1 module](https://llllllll.co/t/2-devices-to-1-host-eurorack-switch-two-one/18826), [ext5v](https://llllllll.co/t/offworld-1-usb-power-utility/9578), [offworld](https://llllllll.co/t/offworld-2-usb-power-utility/7923) or a [USB y-cable](https://llllllll.co/t/ansible-grid-power-issues/7711/25). newer revisions of teletype (black PCB) can power a directly connected grid but you must ensure your power supply provides sufficient power!
